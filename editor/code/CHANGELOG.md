# coq-lsp 0.2.4: (W)Activation
------------------------------

 - The coq-lsp extension now includes a fully working rocq-lsp
   compiled with WebAssembly. This means you can run Rocq without
   having to install it, directly from `vscode.dev` or `github.dev`

   This was made possible thanks to Shachar Itzhaky's excellent
   `ocaml-wasm`.
 - Sentences that take long to execute will be highlighted with a red
   glowing on the client.
 - Support for Rocq 9.1, `_RocqProject`, `rocq` markdown and LaTeX
   codeblocks.
 - Document outline now supports `Notation`, `Ltac`, and `Ltac
   Notation`.

# coq-lsp 0.2.3: Barrage
------------------------

 Mainly small tweaks and improvements, note the changed keybindings in
 OSX; summary of user-visible changes:

 - [vscode] [macos] Resolve keybinding conflict with Cmd+N and
   Cmd+Enter, we now use Alt+N and Alt+Shift+Enter, (Andrei
   Listochkin, #926)
 - [fleche] fix quick fixes for errors being lost due to incorrect
   handling of `send_diags_extra_data` (@ejgallego, #850)
 - [vscode] Syntax highlighting for Coq 8.17-8.20 (@4ever2, #872)
 - [vscode] [web] Fix web extension not exporting the coq-lsp
   extension API (@ejgallego, reported by @amblafont, #911, fixes
   #877)
 - [hover] New option `show_state_hash_on_hover` that displays state
    hash on hover for debug (@ejgallego, #954)
 - [doc] [faq] Updated FAQ to account for VSCoq 2 release in 2023,
   thanks to Patrick Nicodemus for pointing out the outdated
   documentation (@ejgallego, #846, fixes #817)
 - [rocq] [fleche] Disable memprof-limits interruption backend by
   default, as released Rocq versions are not safe yet. If you want to
   enable it, you can still do it with the `--int_backend=Mp` command
   line option (@ejgallego, #957, fixes #857, reported by @dariusf,
   cc: rocq-prover/rocq#19177)
 - [lsp] [controller] Include Rocq feedback on request errors, using
   the optional `data` field. This is useful to still be able to
   obtain feedback messages such as debug messages even when a request
   fails. This also opens the door to better protocol handling and
   petanque integration (@ejgallego, #959, #961)

# coq-lsp 0.2.2: To Virtual or not To Virtual
---------------------------------------------

 - [vscode] Expand selectors to include `vscode-vfs://` URIs used in
   `github.dev`, document limited virtual workspace support in
   `package.json` (@ejgallego, #849)

# coq-lsp 0.2.1: Click !
------------------------

 This release brings full Web Extension support for coq-lsp!

 You can now run Coq from your browser using https://vscode.dev or
 https://github.dev .

 Some other highlights is `codeAction` support (for Coq quick fixes),
 `Restart.` support, better API for our extension users, and many
 bugfixes and improvements, in particular for `hover`.

 The detailed list of server and client changes is below:

 - [workspace] [coq] Support _CoqProject arguments `-type-in-type` and
   `-allow-rewrite-rules` (for 8.20) (@ejgallego, #819)
 - [serlib] Fix Ltac2 AST piercing bug, add test case that should help
   in the future (@ejgallego, @jim-portegies, #821)
 - [fleche] [8.20] understand rewrite rules and symbols on document
   outline (@ejgallego, @Alizter, #825, fixes #824)
 - [fleche] [coq] support `Restart` meta command (@ejgallego,
   @Alizter, #828, fixes #827)
 - [fleche] [plugins] New plugin example `explain_errors`, that will
   print all errors on a file, with their goal context (@ejgallego,
   #829, thanks to @gmalecha for the idea, c.f. Coq issue 19601)
 - [fleche] Highlight the full first line of the document on
   initialization error (@ejgallego, #832)
 - [fleche] [jscoq] [js] Build worker version of `coq-lsp`. This
   provides a full working Coq enviroment in `vscode.dev`. The web
   worker version is build as an artifact on CI (@ejgallego
   @corwin-of-amber, #433)
 - [hover] Fix universe and level printing in hover (#839, fixes #835
   , @ejgallego , @Alizter)
 - [fleche] New immediate request serving mode. In this mode, requests
   are served with whatever document state we have. This is very
   useful when we are not in continuous mode, and we don't have a good
   reference as to what to build, for example in
   `documentSymbols`. The mode actually works pretty well in practice
   as often language requests will come after goals requests, so the
   info that is needed is at hand. It could also be tried to set the
   build target for immediate requests to the view hint, but we should
   see some motivation for that (@ejgallego, #841)
 - [lsp] [diagnostics] (! breaking change) change type of diagnostics
   extra data from list to named record (@ejgallego, #843)
 - [lsp] Implement support for `textDocument/codeAction`. For now, we
   support Coq's 8.21 `quickFix` data (@ejgallego, #840, #843, #845)
 - [petanque] Fix bug for detection of proof finished in deep stacks
   (@ejgallego, @gbdrt, #847)
 - [goals request] allow multiple Coq sentences in `command`. This is
   backwards compatible in the case that commands do not error, and
   users were sending just one command. (@ejgallego, #823, thanks to
   CoqPilot devs and G. Baudart for feedback)
 - [goals request] (! breaking) fail the request if the commands in
   `command` fail (@ejgallego, #823)

# coq-lsp 0.2.0: From Green to Blue
-----------------------------------

 - [fleche] Preserve view hint across document changes. With this
   change, we get local continuous checking mode when the view-port
   heuristic is enabled (@ejgallego, #748)
 - [vscode] Fix focus race when a Coq file is in column 2 (@ejgallego,
   #755, cc: #722, #725)
 - [hover] Show input howto for unicode characters on hover
   (@ejgallego, Léo Stefanesco, #756)
 - [lsp] [definition] Support for jump to definition across workspace
   files. The location information is obtained from `.glob` files, so
   it is often not perfect. (@ejgallego, #762, fixes #317)
 - [lsp] [hover] Show full name and provenance of identifiers
   (@ejgallego, #762)
 - [lsp] [definition] Try also to resolve and locate module imports
   (@ejgallego, #764)
 - [code] Don't start server on extension activation, unless an editor
   we own is active. We also auto-start the server if a document that
   we own is opened later (@ejgallego, #758, fixes #750)
 - [hover] New option `show_universes_on_hover` that will display
   universe data on hover (@ejgallego, @SkySkimmer, #666)
 - [hover] New plugin `unidiff` that will elaborate a summary of
   universe data a file, in particular regarding universes added at
   `Qed` time (@ejgallego, #773)
 - [fleche] Support meta-command `Abort All` (@ejgallego, #774, fixes
   #550)
 - [lsp] [petanque] Allow acces to `petanque` protocol from the lsp
   server (@ejgallego, #778)

  See server changelog for full server-side changes.

# coq-lsp 0.1.10: Hasta el 40 de Mayo _en effect_...
----------------------------------------------------

 - [code] Add `.v.tex` file extension to contributed language support
   (@ejgallego, #740).

   #741, fix #737)

# coq-lsp 0.1.9: Hasta el 40 de Mayo...
---------------------------------------

 - display the continous/on-request checking mode in the status bar,
   allow to change it by clicking on it (@ejgallego, #721)
 - new Coq Language Status Item that display server status, version,
   and memory use. We recommend the users to pin it.
 - new heatmap feature allowing timing data to be seen in the
   editor. use the `Coq LSP: Toggle heatmap` command. Colors and
   granularity are configurable, see settings (@Alizter, #686)
 - new VSCode commands to allow to move one sentence backwards /
   forward, this is particularly useful when combined with lazy
   checking mode (@ejgallego, #671, fixes #263, fixes #580)
 - VSCode commands `coq-lsp.sentenceNext` / `coq-lsp.sentencePrevious`
   are now bound by default to `Alt + N` / `Alt + P` keybindings
   (@ejgallego, #718)
 - new option `show_loc_info_on_hover` that will display parsing debug
   information on hover
 - fix activation bug that prevented extension activation for `.mv`
   files (@ejgallego @r3m0t, #598, cc #596, reported by Théo Zimmerman)
 - require VSCode >= 1.82 in package.json. (@ejgallego, #599,
   thanks to Théo Zimmerman for the report)
 - update progress indicator correctly on End Of File (@ejgallego,
   #605, fixes #445)
 - switch default of `goal_after_tactic` to `true` (@Alizter,
   @ejgallego, cc: #614)
 - error recovery: Recognize `Defined` and `Admitted` in lex recovery
   (@ejgallego, #616)
 - don't trigger the goals window in general markdown buffer
   (@ejgallego, #625, reported by Théo Zimmerman)
 - fix typo on package.json configuration section (@ejgallego, #645)
 - support for Coq 8.16 has been abandoned due to lack of dev
   resources (@ejgallego, #649)
 - new "Coq LSP: Free Memory" command to liberate space used in the
   cache (@ejgallego, #662, fixes #367 cc: #253 #236 #348)
 - fix Coq performance view display panel (@ejgallego, #663,
   regression in #513)
 - new public VSCode extension API so other extensions can perform
   actions when the user request the goals (@ejgallego, @bhaktishh,
   #672, fixes #538)
 - Support Visual Studio Live Share URIs better (`vsls://`), in
   particular don't try to display goals if the URI is VSLS one
   (@ejgallego, #676)

   (@ejgallego, @Alizter, #689, #693)
 - New client option to enable / disable `coq/perfData` (@ejgallego, #717)

   JSON data in a new editor (@ejgallego, #701)
 - Update server settings on the fly when tweaking them in VSCode.
   Implement `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` (@ejgallego, #702)
 - Always dispose UI elements. This should improve some strange
   behaviors on extension restart (@ejgallego, #708)
 - Support Coq meta-commands (Reset, Reset Initial, Back) They are
   actually pretty useful to hint the incremental engine to ignore
   changes in some part of the document (@ejgallego, #709)
 - New `coq/viewRange` notification, from client to server, than hints
   the scheduler for the visible area of the document; combined with
   the new lazy checking mode, this provides checking on scroll, a
   feature inspired from Isabelle IDE (@ejgallego, #717)
 - Have VSCode wait for full LSP client shutdown on server
   restart. This fixes some bugs on extension restart (finally!)
   (@ejgallego, #719)
 - Center the view if cursor goes out of scope in
   `sentenceNext/sentencePrevious` (@ejgallego, #718)
 - Switch Flèche range encoding to protocol native, this means UTF-16
   code points for now (Léo Stefanesco, @ejgallego, #624, fixes #620,
   #621)
 - Give `Goals` panel focus back if it has lost it (in case of
   multiple panels in the second viewColumn of Vscode) whenever

 - Add an example of multiple workspaces (@ejgallego, @Blaisorblade,
   #611)

   (@ejgallego, @Alizter, #731 cc #525)

# coq-lsp 0.1.8: Trick-or-treat
-------------------------------

 - Update VSCode client dependencies, should bring some performance
   improvements to goal pretty printing (@ejgallego, #530)
 - Update goal display colors for light mode so they are actually
   readable now. (@bhaktishh, #539, fixes #532)
 - Added link to Python coq-lsp client by Pedro Carrot and Nuno
   Saavedra (@Nfsaavedra, #536)
 - Properly concatenate warnings from _CoqProject (@ejgallego,
   reported by @mituharu, #541, fixes #540)
 - Fix broken `coq/saveVo` and `coq/getDocument` requests due to a
   parsing problem with extra fields in their requests (@ejgallego,
   #547, reported by @Zimmi48)
 - `fcc` now understands the `--coqlib`, `--coqcorelib`,
   `--ocamlpath`, `-Q` and `-R` arguments (@ejgallego, #555)
 - Describe findlib status in `Workspace.describe`, which is printed
   in the output windows (@ejgallego, #556)
 - `coq-lsp` plugin loader will now be strict in case of a plugin
   failure, the previous loose behavior was more convenient for the
   early releases, but it doesn't make sense now and made things
   pretty hard to debug on the Windows installer (@ejgallego, #557)
 - Add pointers to Windows installers (@ejgallego, #559)
 - Recognize `Goal` and `Definition $id : ... .` as proof starters
   (@ejgallego, #561, reported by @Zimmi48, fixes #548)
 - Provide basic notation information on hover. This is intended for
   people to build their own more refined notation feedback systems
   (@ejgallego, #562)
 - Hover request can now be extended by plugins (@ejgallego, #562)
 - Updated LSP and JS client libs, notably to vscode-languageclient 9
   (@ejgallego, #565)
 - Implement a LIFO document scheduler, this is heavier in the
   background as more documents will be checked, but provides a few
   usability improvements (@ejgallego, #566, fixes #563, reported by
   Ali Caglayan)
 - New lexical qed detection error recovery rule; this makes a very
   large usability difference in practice when editing inside proofs.
   (@ejgallego, #567, fixes #33)
 - `coq-lsp` is now supported by the `coq-nix-toolbox` (@Zimmi48,
   @CohenCyril, #572, via
   https://github.com/coq-community/coq-nix-toolbox/pull/164 )
 - Support for `-rifrom` in `_CoqProject` and in command line
   (`--rifrom`). Thanks to Lasse Blaauwbroek for the report.
   (@ejgallego, #581, fixes #579)
 - Export Query Goals API in VSCode client; this way other extensions
   can implement their own commands that query Coq goals (@amblafont,
   @ejgallego, #576, closes #558)
 - New `pretac` field for preprocessing of goals with a tactic using
   speculative execution, this is experimental for now (@amblafont,
   @ejgallego, #573, helps with #558)
 - Implement `textDocument/selectionRange` request, that will return
   the range of the Coq sentence underlying the cursor. In VSCode,
   this is triggered by the "Expand Selection" command. The
   implementation is partial: we only take into account the first
   position, and we only return a single range (Coq sentence) without
   parents. (@ejgallego, #582)
 - Be more robust to mixed-separator windows paths in workspace
   detection (@ejgallego, #583, fixes #569)
 - Adjust printing breaks in error and message panels (@ejgallego,
   @Alizter, #586, fixes #457 , fixes #458 , fixes #571)

# coq-lsp 0.1.7: Just-in-time
-----------------------------

- Enable web extension support (worker server will happen in next release)
- Improvements and clenaups on hover display, in particular we don't
  print repeated `Notation` strings.

- Hook coq-lsp to ViZX extension
- Warnings settings from `_CoqProject` files are now applied
- Limit the number of messages displayed in the goal window to 101,
  as to workaround slow render of Coq's pretty printing format. This
  is an issue for example in Search where we can get thousand of
  results. We also speed up the rendering a bit by not hashing twice,
  and fix a parameter-passing bug in the React setup.
