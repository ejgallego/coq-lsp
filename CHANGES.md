 - `coq-lsp` will now warn the user when two files have been opened
   simultaneously and the parser may go into a broken state :/
   (@ejgallego, #169)

   `documentSymbols` will now be postponed until the document is
   ready, (@ejgallego, #141, #146, fixes #124)
 - Protocol and VS Code interfaces now support shelved and given_up
   goals (@ejgallego, #175)
 - Allow to postpone requests to wait for data to become available on
   document points; this is implemented to provide a nicer "show goals

   `Search` are not shown anymore as diagnostics. Instead, they will
   be shown on the side panel when clicking on the corresponding
   command. The `show_notices_as_diagnostics` option allows to restore
   old behavior (@ejgallego, #128, fixes #125)
 - Print some more info about Coq workspace configuration (@ejgallego, #151)

   behavior to follow cursor in different ways (@ejgallego, #116,
