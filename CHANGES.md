# unreleased
------------

 - new option `show_loc_info_on_hover` that will display parsing debug
   information on hover; previous flag was fixed in code, which is way
   less flexible. This also fixes the option being on in 0.1.8 by
   mistake (@ejgallego, #588)
 - hover plugins can now access the full document, this is convenient
   for many use cases (@ejgallego, #591)
 - fix hover position computation on the presence of Utf characters
   (@ejgallego, #597, thanks to Pierre Courtieu for the report and
   example, closes #594)
 - fix activation bug that prevented extension activation for `.mv`
   files, see discussion in the issues about the upstream policy
   (@ejgallego @r3m0t, #598, cc #596, reported by Théo Zimmerman)
 - require VSCode >= 1.82 in package.json . Our VSCode extension uses
   `vscode-languageclient` 9 which imposes this. (@ejgallego, #599,
   thanks to Théo Zimmerman for the report)
 - `proof/goals` request: new `mode` parameter, to specify goals
   after/before sentence display; renamed `pretac` to `command`, as to
   provide official support for speculative execution (@ejgallego, #600)
 - fix some cases where interrupted computations where memoized
   (@ejgallego, #603)
 - [internal] Flèche [Doc.t] API will now absorb errors on document
   update and creation into the document itself. Thus, a document that
   failed to create or update is still valid, but in the right failed
   state. This is a much needed API change for a lot of use cases
   (@ejgallego, #604)
 - support OCaml 5.1.x (@ejgallego, #606)
 - update progress indicator correctly on End Of File (@ejgallego,
   #605, fixes #445)
 - [plugins] New `astdump` plugin to dump AST of files into JSON and
   SEXP (@ejgallego, #607)
 - errors on save where not properly caught (@ejgallego, #608)
 - switch default of `goal_after_tactic` to `true` (@Alizter,
   @ejgallego, cc: #614)
 - error recovery: Recognize `Defined` and `Admitted` in lex recovery
   (@ejgallego, #616)
 - completion: correctly understand UTF-16 code points on completion
   request (Léo Stefanesco, #613, fixes #531)
 - don't trigger the goals window in general markdown buffer
   (@ejgallego, #625, reported by Théo Zimmerman)
 - allow not to postpone full document requests (#626, @ejgallego)
 - new configuration value `check_only_on_request` which will delay
   checking the document until a request has been made (#629, cc: #24,
   @ejgallego)
 - fix typo on package.json configuration section (@ejgallego, #645)
 - be more resilient with invalid _CoqProject files (@ejgallego, #646)
 - support for Coq 8.16 has been abandoned due to lack of dev
   resources (@ejgallego, #649)
 - new option `--no_vo` for `fcc`, which will skip the `.vo` saving
   step. `.vo` saving is now an `fcc` plugins, but for now, it is
   enabled by default (@ejgallego, #650)
 - depend on `memprof-limits` on OCaml 4.x (@ejgallego, #660)
 - bump minimal OCaml version to 4.12 due to `memprof-limits`
   (@ejgallego, #660)
 - monitor all Coq-level calls under an interruption token
   (@ejgallego, #661)
 - interpret require thru our own custom execution env-aware path
   (@bhaktishh, @ejgallego, #642, #643, #644)
 - new `coq-lsp.plugin.goaldump` plugin, as an example on how to dump
   goals from a document (@ejgallego @gbdrt, #619)
 - new trim command (both in the server and in VSCode) to liberate
   space used in the cache (@ejgallego, #662, fixes #367 cc: #253 #236
   #348)
 - completion and notation display (@ejgallego, #41 ???)

# coq-lsp 0.1.8.1: Spring fix
-----------------------------

 - call to VizCar vscode extension, mirroring behavior for
   vizx. (@bhaktishh, #655)

# coq-lsp 0.1.8: Trick-or-treat
-------------------------------

 - Update VSCode client dependencies, should bring some performance
   improvements to goal pretty printing (@ejgallego, #530)
 - Update goal display colors for light mode so they are actually
   readable now. (@bhaktishh, #539, fixes #532)
 - Added link to Python coq-lsp client by Pedro Carrot and Nuno
   Saavedra (@Nfsaavedra, #536)
 - Properly concatenate warnings from _CoqProject (@ejgallego,
   reported by @mituharu, #541, fixes #540)
 - Fix broken `coq/saveVo` and `coq/getDocument` requests due to a
   parsing problem with extra fields in their requests (@ejgallego,
   #547, reported by @Zimmi48)
 - `fcc` now understands the `--coqlib`, `--coqcorelib`,
   `--ocamlpath`, `-Q` and `-R` arguments (@ejgallego, #555)
 - Describe findlib status in `Workspace.describe`, which is printed
   in the output windows (@ejgallego, #556)
 - `coq-lsp` plugin loader will now be strict in case of a plugin
   failure, the previous loose behavior was more convenient for the
   early releases, but it doesn't make sense now and made things
   pretty hard to debug on the Windows installer (@ejgallego, #557)
 - Add pointers to Windows installers (@ejgallego, #559)
 - Recognize `Goal` and `Definition $id : ... .` as proof starters
   (@ejgallego, #561, reported by @Zimmi48, fixes #548)
 - Provide basic notation information on hover. This is intended for
   people to build their own more refined notation feedback systems
   (@ejgallego, #562)
 - Hover request can now be extended by plugins (@ejgallego, #562)
 - Updated LSP and JS client libs, notably to vscode-languageclient 9
   (@ejgallego, #565)
 - Implement a LIFO document scheduler, this is heavier in the
   background as more documents will be checked, but provides a few
   usability improvements (@ejgallego, #566, fixes #563, reported by
   Ali Caglayan)
 - New lexical qed detection error recovery rule; this makes a very
   large usability difference in practice when editing inside proofs.
   (@ejgallego, #567, fixes #33)
 - `coq-lsp` is now supported by the `coq-nix-toolbox` (@Zimmi48,
   @CohenCyril, #572, via
   https://github.com/coq-community/coq-nix-toolbox/pull/164 )
 - Support for `-rifrom` in `_CoqProject` and in command line
   (`--rifrom`). Thanks to Lasse Blaauwbroek for the report.
   (@ejgallego, #581, fixes #579)
 - Export Query Goals API in VSCode client; this way other extensions
   can implement their own commands that query Coq goals (@amblafont,
   @ejgallego, #576, closes #558)
 - New `pretac` field for preprocessing of goals with a tactic using
   speculative execution, this is experimental for now (@amblafont,
   @ejgallego, #573, helps with #558)
 - Implement `textDocument/selectionRange` request, that will return
   the range of the Coq sentence underlying the cursor. In VSCode,
   this is triggered by the "Expand Selection" command. The
   implementation is partial: we only take into account the first
   position, and we only return a single range (Coq sentence) without
   parents. (@ejgallego, #582)
 - Be more robust to mixed-separator windows paths in workspace
   detection (@ejgallego, #583, fixes #569)
 - Adjust printing breaks in error and message panels (@ejgallego,
   @Alizter, #586, fixes #457 , fixes #458 , fixes #571)

# coq-lsp 0.1.7: Just-in-time
-----------------------------

 - New command line compiler `fcc`. `fcc` allows to access most
   features of `coq-lsp` without the need for a command line client,
   and it has been designed to be extensible and machine-friendly
   (@ejgallego, #507, fixes #472)
 - Enable web extension support. For now this will not try to start
   the coq-lsp worker as it is not yet built. (@ejgallego, #430, fixes
   #234)
 - Improvements and clenaups on hover display, in particular we don't
   print repeated `Notation` strings (@ejgallego, #422)
 - Don't fail on missing serlib plugins, they are indeed an
   optimization; this mostly impacts 8.16 by lowering the SerAPI
   requirements (@ejgallego, #421)
 - Fix bug that prevented "Goal after tactic" from working properly
   (@ejgallego, #438, reported by David Ilcinkas)
 - Fix "Error message browser becomes non-visible when there are many
   goals" by using a fixed-position separated error display (@TDiazT,
   #455, fixes #441)
 - Message about workspace detection was printing the wrong file,
   (@ejgallego, #444, reported by Alex Sanchez-Stern)

   #262)
 - Preliminary support to display document performance data in panel
   (@ejgallego, #181)
 - Fix cases when workspace / root URIs are `null`, as per LSP spec,
   (#453 , reported by orilahav, fixes #283)
 - Pass implicit argument information to hover printer (@ejgallego, #453,
   fixes #448)
 - Fix keybinding for the "Show Goals at Point" command (@4ever2, #460)
 - Alert when `rootPath` is relative (#465, @ejgallego, report by Alex
   Sanchez-Stern)
 - Hook coq-lsp to ViZX extension (@bhaktishh, #469)
 - `proof/goals` request now takes an optional formatting parameter
   so clients can specify it per-request (@ejgallego, @bhaktishh, #470)
 - New command line argument `--idle-delay=$secs` that controls how
   much an idle server will sleep before going back to request
   processing. Default setting is `0.1`, using more aggressive
   settings like `0.01` can decrease latency of requests by ~4x
   (@ejgallego, @hazardouspeach, #467, #471)
 - Warnings from `_CoqProject` files are now applied (@ejgallego,
   reported by @arthuraa, #500)
 - Be more resilient when serializing unknowns Asts (@ejgallego, #503,
   reported by Gijs Pennings)
 - Coq's STM is not linked anymore to `coq-lsp` (@ejgallego, #511)
 - More granular options `send_perf_data` `send_diags`, `verbosity`
   will set them now (@ejgallego, #517)
 - Preliminary plugin API for completion events (@ejgallego, #518,
   fixes #506)
 - Limit the number of messages displayed in the goal window to 101,
   as to workaround slow render of Coq's pretty printing format. This
   is an issue for example in Search where we can get thousand of
   results. We also speed up the rendering a bit by not hashing twice,
   and fix a parameter-passing bug. (@ejgallego, #523, reported by
   Anton Podkopaev)

# coq-lsp 0.1.6: Peek
---------------------

   #386)
 - Hover symbol information: hypothesis names must shadow globals of
   the same name (@ejgallego, #391, fixes #388)
 - De-schedule document on didClose, otherwise the scheduler will keep
   trying to resume it if it didn't finish (@ejgallego, #392)

 - Server status icon will now react properly to fatal server errors
   (@ejgallego, reported by @Alizter, #411, fixes #399)

   editor. Use the new "Save to .vo" command, or the new protocol
   `coq/saveVo` request (@ejgallego, #417, fixes #339)

# coq-lsp 0.1.5.1: Path

 - Markdown Coq code blocks now must specify "coq" as a language
   (@ejgallego, #280)
 - Server is now more strict w.r.t. what URIs it will accept for
   documents, see protocol documentation (@ejgallego, #286, reported
   by Alex Sanchez-Stern)
 - Hypotheses with bodies are now correctly displayed (@ejgallego,
   #296, fixes #293, report by Ali Caglayan)
 - `coq-lsp` incorrectly required the optional `rootPath`
   initialization parameter, moreover it ignored `rootUri` if present
   which goes against the LSP spec (@ejgallego, #295, report by Alex
   Sanchez-Stern)
 - `coq-lsp` will now reject opening multiple files when the
   underlying Coq version is buggy (@ejgallego, fixes #275, fixes

   to accept less URIs (@ejgallego, #260)
 - `_CoqProject` file is now detected using LSP client `rootPath`

 - `coq-lsp` now follows the LSP specification regarding
   initialization strictly (@ejgallego, #168)
 - New setting for goals to be updated when the selection changes due
   to a command; this makes VsCodeVim cursor tracking work; thanks to
   Cactus (Anton) Golov for detailed bug reporting and testing
   (@ejgallego, @jesyspa, #170, fixes #163)
 - `coq-lsp` will now warn the user when two files have been opened
   simultaneously and the parser may go into a broken state :/
   (@ejgallego, #169)
 - Implement request postponement and cancellation. Thus
   `documentSymbols` will now be postponed until the document is
   ready, (@ejgallego, #141, #146, fixes #124)
 - Protocol and VS Code interfaces now support shelved and given_up
   goals (@ejgallego, #175)
 - Allow to postpone requests to wait for data to become available on
   document points; this is implemented to provide a nicer "show goals
   while I type" experience. Client default has been changed to "show
   goals on mouse, click, typing, and cursor movement) (@ejgallego,
   #177, #179)
 - Store stats per document (@ejgallego, #180, fixes #173)

 - A detailed view of Coq errors is now displayed in the info panel
   (@ejgallego, #128)
 - Coq "Notice" messages, such as the ones generated by `About` or
   `Search` are not shown anymore as diagnostics. Instead, they will
   be shown on the side panel when clicking on the corresponding
   command. The `show_notices_as_diagnostics` option allows to restore
   old behavior (@ejgallego, #128, fixes #125)
 - Print some more info about Coq workspace configuration (@ejgallego, #151)
 - Admit failed `Qed` by default; allow users to configure it
