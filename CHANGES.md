# coq-lsp 0.1.4: View
---------------------

 - Support for OCaml 4.11 (@ejgallego, #184)
 - The keybinding alt+enter in VSCode is now correctly scoped to be
   only active on Coq files (@artagnon, #188)
 - Support Unicode files (@ejgallego, #200, fixes #193, fixes #197)
 - The info view is now script enabled and does client-side
   rendering. It is also now bundled with esbuild as part of the build
   process (@artagnon, @ejgallego, #171)
 - The no-op `--std` argument to the `coq-lsp` binary has been
   removed, beware of your setup in the extension settings
   (@ejgallego, #208)
 - Settings for the VSCode extension are now categorized (@Alizter, #212)
 - `GoalAnswer`s now include the proof "stack" and better hypothesis
   information, changes are compatible with 0.1.3 `GoalAnswer` version
   (@ejgallego, #237)
 - Focus is now preserved when the info view pops up (@artagnon, #242,
   fixes #224)
 - In `_CoqProject`, `-impredicative-set` is now parsed correctly
   (@artagnon, #241)
 - InfoView is not written in React (@ejgallego, #223)

# coq-lsp 0.1.3: Event
----------------------

 - Much improved handling of Coq fatal errors, the server is now
   hardened against them (@ejgallego, #155, #157, #160, fixes #91)
 - `coq-lsp` now follows the LSP specification regarding
   initialization strictly (@ejgallego, #168)
 - New setting for goals to be updated when the selection changes due
   to a command; this makes VsCodeVim cursor tracking work; thanks to
   Cactus (Anton) Golov for detailed bug reporting and testing
   (@ejgallego, @jesyspa, #170, fixes #163)
 - `coq-lsp` will now warn the user when two files have been opened
   simultaneously and the parser may go into a broken state :/
   (@ejgallego, #169)
 - Implement request postponement and cancellation. Thus
   `documentSymbols` will now be postponed until the document is
   ready, (@ejgallego, #141, #146, fixes #124)
 - Protocol and VS Code interfaces now support shelved and given_up
   goals (@ejgallego, #175)
 - Allow to postpone requests to wait for data to become available on
   document points; this is implemented to provide a nicer "show goals
   while I type" experience. Client default has been changed to "show
   goals on mouse, click, typing, and cursor movement) (@ejgallego,
   #177, #179)
 - Store stats per document (@ejgallego, #180, fixes #173)

# coq-lsp 0.1.2: Message
------------------------

 - Send an error to the client if the client and server versions don't
   match (@ejgallego, #126)
 - Parse options -noinit, -indices-matter, and -impredicative-set from
   `_CoqProject` (@artagnon, @ejgallego, #140, #150)
 - Log file `log-lsp.txt` has been removed in favor of `coq-lsp.trace.server`
   (@artagnon, @ejgallego, #130, #148)
 - Added --bt flag to print a backtrace on error (@Alizter, #147)
 - A detailed view of Coq errors is now displayed in the info panel
   (@ejgallego, #128)
 - Coq "Notice" messages, such as the ones generated by `About` or
   `Search` are not shown anymore as diagnostics. Instead, they will
   be shown on the side panel when clicking on the corresponding
   command. The `show_notices_as_diagnostics` option allows to restore
   old behavior (@ejgallego, #128, fixes #125)
 - Print some more info about Coq workspace configuration (@ejgallego, #151)
 - Admit failed `Qed` by default; allow users to configure it
   (@ejgallego, #118, fixes #90)

   similarly to what Lean does; display them in Code's right gutter

   behavior to follow cursor in different ways (@ejgallego, #116,
